# Boost SDK

Boost is an open-source protocol that anyone can access and build on to deploy and distribute incentives. The Boost SDK is a set of developer tools and resources designed to make it easy. This section outlines the tools available in the Boost SDK and what you can build.

### **Boost SDK Plugins**

To deploy incentives for a specific project on Boost, the project’s smart contract must be registered to the protocol. Creating a Boost Plugin is how Boost can translate and standardize your project’s transaction data to be used on the protocol.

### **Boost Client SDK**

The Boost Client SDK makes it easy to leverage Boost’s functionality to create a custom frontend application. [Boost Inbox](https://inbox.boost.xyz/) is an example of a Boost Client that will soon be open-sourced.

### **Boost API**

Embedding boosts into your native application is an easy way to boost the user experience and reward your users where they are. With just a few lines of code, you can retrieve boost details and embed it into your platform for users to easily discover and access incentive offers. This also enables you to earn a share of the revenue as a Boost Affiliate.&#x20;
