# Protocol Rewards

Boost Protocol relies on the contributions of several network participants to function and grow. It needs individuals to issue incentives, earn rewards and spread the wordâ€“but each relies on the other to thrive and succeed.

By sharing revenue, all participants are incentivized to continue contributing, driving healthy and sustainable growth for the protocol. The following is an overview of how the protocol fees are distributed back to all participants.

### **Fee split (per Boost completion)**

Boost Issuers are required to deposit an additional 5% of the total token amount of the boost incentive being deployed. Half of this amount is distributed to the Boost Guild to reinvest back into Boost Protocol and up to the other half is distributed to the Boost Affiliates. Any unused fees to affiliates will go back to the Boost Issuer.

| Network Participant | Reward Distributed                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boost Affiliate     | 50% of the protocol fee (unused amounts will go back to Boost Issuers) |
| Boost Guild         | 50% of the protocol fee                                                |
