# Protocol Rewards

Boost Protocol relies on the contributions of several network participants to function and grow. It needs individuals to issue incentives, earn rewards and spread the wordâ€“but each relies on the other to thrive and succeed.

By sharing revenue, all participants are incentivized to continue contributing, driving healthy and sustainable growth for the protocol. The following is an overview of how the protocol fees are distributed back to all participants.

### **Fee split (per Boost completion)**

Boost Issuers are required to deposit an additional 20% of the total token amount of the boost incentive being deployed. Half of this amount is distributed back to the Boost Issuer and the other half is distributed to the Boost Guild to reinvest back into Boost Protocol.

| Network Participant | Reward Distributed      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Boost Issuer        | 50% of the protocol fee |
| Boost Affiliate     | 25% of the protocol fee |
| Boost Guild         | 25% of the protocol fee |
