# Protocol Fees

To ensure the sustainability and continued development of Boost Protocol, Boost Issuers are required to deposit an additional 20% of the total token amount of the boost being deployed. Half of that amount, which is 10%, is returned back to the Boost Issuer whenever a user completes and claims their token reward. The remaining 10% is equally split between the Boost Treasury and the Boost Affiliate that referred the boost.

| Boost Creator   | 10% on top of total reward amount |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Boost Treasury  | 5% on top of total reward amount  |
| Boost Affiliate | 5% on top of total reward amount  |

While the protocol takes fees and generates revenue, all the funds are reinvested back into the protocol through the Boost Treasury. It is governed by the Boost Guild, a coalition of community stakeholders that make proposals and votes on how treasury funds should be used to drive further growth and adoption
