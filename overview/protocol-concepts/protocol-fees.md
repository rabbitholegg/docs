# Protocol Fees

To ensure the sustainability and continued development of Boost Protocol, Boost Issuers are required to deposit an additional 5% of the total token amount of the boost being deployed. Half of that amount, which is 2.5%, is used to reward affiliate referrals or returned back to the Boost Issuer whenever a user completes and claims their token reward. The remaining 2.5% goes to the Boost Guild Treasury.

| Boost Guild Treasury | 2.5% of total reward amount        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Boost Affiliate      | 2.5% on top of total reward amount |

While the protocol takes fees and generates revenue, all the funds are reinvested back into the protocol through the Boost Guild Treasury. It is governed by the Boost Guild, a coalition of community stakeholders that make proposals and votes on how treasury funds should be used to drive further growth and adoption
