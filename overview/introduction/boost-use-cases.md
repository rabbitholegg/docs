# Boost Use Cases

Boost is a highly versatile and credibly neutral network for distributing incentives. Any wallet address can use Boost to deploy any token to incentivize any crypto user to perform any action onchain.

While there is no permission required or rules on how to use the protocol,  these are just some of the most common boost use cases:

* **Increase delegation power** by incentivizing delegation to any address
* **Increase holders** by incentivizing swapping to any token
* **Increase bridge deposits** by incentivizing bridging from any network
* **Increase minting** of incentivizing mints of specific NFTs
* **Increase voting participation** by incentivizing voting on specific proposals

Whether you are looking to boost protocol activity or engage loyal users, Boost provides the flexibility to quickly deploy incentive offers, iterate and optimize so you can actually get the results you want.&#x20;
