description: How to claim a Boost for an end user
---

Once an end user has completed a boosted action, the boost reward can be claimed by submitting a transaction signed by the end user on the chain of the reward token.

Prerequisites for claiming a boost include:

* the boost contract address (specific to each boost), which can be queried using [the boost details endpoint](fetch-boosts.md#querying-details-for-a-specific-boost) or found at `boost.contractAddress` in the response from [the create boost endpoint](create-a-boost.md#submitting-the-create-boost-request)
* the boost factory contract ABI, which can be found [here](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/questdk/blob/main/src/abi/quest-factory.ts)
* a signature from the Boost API vouching that a specific end user has completed the action for a currently active boost

## Getting a boost completion signature

Before submitting the claim transaction, a signature verifying the completion of the specific boost action by the end user must be requested from [the /boosts/get-signature endpoint](https://api.boost.xyz/docs#tag/boosts/paths/\~1boosts\~1get-signature/post).

```typescript
const getSignatureResponse = await fetch('https://api.boost.xyz/boosts/get-signature', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    boostId: '44aa700e-dad7-41cc-beee-73cce9f60598',
    address: '0x242c295e88760559a6ca8e8f02bb52cdcf7f7422'
  })
});

const { signature, compressedBytes, fee } = await getSignatureResponse.json();
```

<Tip>
    While the raw `signature` is available in the response, the `compressedBytes` parameter of the response can be passed directly to the claim transaction below. Additionally, the required gas `fee` to claim the boost is available in the response for convenience.
</Tip>

## Claiming a boost reward

The following example demonstrates a claim of a reward in $DEGEN token on Base using the `viem` package and the `compressedBytes` param from the previous section:

```typescript
import { type WalletClient, type PublicClient } from 'viem';
import boostFactoryAbi from './abis/boostFactory';

async function claimBoostReward(
  publicClient: PublicClient,
  walletClient: WalletClient,
  boostContractAddress: string, // taken from GET /boosts/[boostId] response
  compressedBytes: string, // taken from GET/boosts/get-signature response
  fee: string, // taken from GET/boosts/get-signature response
) {
  const { request } = await publicClient.simulateContract({
    account: walletClient.account.address,
    address: boostContractAddress,
    abi: boostFactoryAbi,
    functionName: 'claimCompressed',
    args: [compressedBytes as Hex],
    value: BigInt(fee),
  });

  const txHash = await walletClient.writeContract(request);
}
```

## Batching claims

For applications where batching of user claims is preferable, use [the /boosts/get-signature-batch endpoint](https://api.boost.xyz/docs#tag/boosts/paths/\~1boosts\~1get-signature-batch/post) to query multiple signatures at once:

```typescript
const getSignatureBatchResponse = await fetch('https://api.boost.xyz/boosts/get-signature-batch', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify([
    {
      boostId: '44aa700e-dad7-41cc-beee-73cce9f60598',
      address: '0x242c295e88760559a6ca8e8f02bb52cdcf7f7422'
    },
    {
      boostId: '44aa700e-dad7-41cc-beee-73cce9f60598',
      address: '0x242c295e88760559a6ca8e8f02bb52cdcf7f7422'
    },
  ])
});

const signatureObjects = await getSignatureBatchResponse.json();
```

<Tip>
    Note that individual signature request failures fail silently for [the /boosts/get-signature-batch endpoint](https://api.boost.xyz/docs#tag/boosts/paths/\~1boosts\~1get-signature-batch/post), resulting in the failing signature requests being omitted from the response.
    To get error information on a specific signature request failure, use the singular [/boosts/get-signature endpoint](https://api.boost.xyz/docs#tag/boosts/paths/\~1boosts\~1get-signature/post).
