1. **Find your custom Boost affiliate link.** Connect your wallet to the [Boost App](https://boost.xyz/) and head to the ‘Refer’ tab.
2. **Share your link with your audience.** Either share the link directly with your audience, integrate it into your existing platform or spin up a custom frontend client like Boost Inbox.
3. **Earn on every boost completion.** When a user successfully completes a boost via your affiliate link or platform, you immediately receive 2.5% of the reward amount deposited by the issuer.
4. **Claim your affiliate reward.** To keep track and claim your affiliate earnings, head to the Referral page in the [Boost App](https://boost.xyz/). You can view how much you’re earning on active boosts and claim your rewards after completion.
