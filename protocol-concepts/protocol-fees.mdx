title: 'Protocol Fees'

To ensure the sustainability and continued development of Boost Protocol, Boost Issuers are required to deposit an additional 5% of the total token amount of the boost being deployed. That 5% is equally split between the Boost Guild Treasury and the Boost Affiliate that referred the boost.

| Fee Recipient         | Fee Amount                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Boost Guild Treasury  | **2.5%** on top of total reward amount  |
| Boost Affiliate       | **2.5%** on top of total reward amount  |

While the protocol takes fees and generates revenue, all the funds are reinvested back into the protocol through the Boost Guild Treasury. It is governed by the Boost Guild, a coalition of community stakeholders that make proposals and votes on how treasury funds should be used to drive further growth and adoption.
