title: 'How to Add a Token to the Whitelist'
---

To use a specific token as a reward for boosts on Boost Protocol, the token must be added to the approved whitelist. This process ensures the stability, security, and compliance of tokens used within the Boost ecosystem.

## Whitelist Criteria

To be considered for the whitelist, tokens need to meet certain criteria. Here are a few key factors we consider when evaluating tokens:

- Token liquidity and market capitalization
- Smart contract security and audit status
- Regulatory compliance
- Project stability and reputation

## Application Process

If you would like to have a token added to the reward token whitelist, please follow these steps:

1. **Review Requirements**: Ensure the token meets the basic criteria mentioned above.

2. **Submit Application**: Fill out the token whitelist application form [here](). You will need to provide:
   - Token Name
   - Contract Address
   - Network (Base, Optimism, Polygon, etc.)
   - Additional project and token information

3. **Review Process**: Our team will review your application. This process typically takes 5-10 business days.

4. **Approval**: If approved, the token will be added to the whitelist and will be available for use in the Boost Ecosystem.
