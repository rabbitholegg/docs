title: 'How to Add Your Project to the Boost Registry'
---

[//]: # (TODO: update links on this page)
To deploy incentives for a specific project on Boost, the project must integrate with Boost Protocol by [creating a Boost Plugin](https://docs.boost.xyz/boost-protocol/for-developers/boost-sdk-plugins). Once your plugin has been approved, your project will be added to the [Boost Registry](https://manager.boost.xyz/registry) and will be made available on Boost Manager.

The following are some requirements to integrate your project with Boost Protocol:

* **Actions must be onchain**
* Supported on one or more of the following networks: Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Ethereum, Zora, ZkSync, Mantle, Blast, Degen, Cyber
* Use a supported [ActionType](https://docs.boost.xyz/boost-protocol/for-developers/boost-sdk-plugins/core-concepts/actions#action-types) (swap, mint, bridge, etc.)

If the desired action type youâ€™d like to incentivize is currently not supported on Boost, you can make a request by filling out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrLVU8kSFnJPLjNn).

To start, read the documentation on [how to build a plugin](https://docs.boost.xyz/boost-protocol/for-developers/boost-sdk-plugins). If you have questions or need additional support, please [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/gdu3EpeqsD).
