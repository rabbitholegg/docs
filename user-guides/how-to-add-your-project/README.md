# How to Add Your Project

If your project is not currently supported on Boost, there are a few steps you will need to follow to ensure that you are all set-up to start issuing incentives:

1. Add your project to the Boost Registry by [building a Boost SDK Plugin](../../for-developers/boost-sdk-plugins/)
2. Whitelist your token reward _(optional)_

Once you complete these steps and theyâ€™ve been reviewed by the core team, you will be able to start creating boosts for your project on the Boost Manager app. Anyone will be able to issue rewards for your project, no permission required.
