# Whitelist a Token Reward

If the token reward that you would like to issue as an incentive is not currently supported on Boost Protocol, you will need to request to have it whitelisted.

Token whitelist requests are processed through the Boost Guild, a coalition of community stakeholders that govern Boost Protocol. More details coming soon.
