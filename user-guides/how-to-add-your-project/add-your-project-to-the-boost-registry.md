# Add Your Project to the Boost Registry

To deploy incentives for a specific project on Boost, the project must integrate with Boost Protocol by [creating a Boost Plugin](../../for-developers/boost-sdk-plugins/). Once your plugin has been approved, your project will be added to the [Boost Registry](https://manager.boost.xyz/registry) and will be made available on Boost Manager.

The following are some requirements to integrate your project with Boost Protocol:

* **Actions must be onchain**
* Supported on one or more of the following networks: Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Ethereum
* Use a supported [ActionType](../../for-developers/boost-sdk-plugins/core-concepts/actions.md#action-types) (swap, mint, bridge, etc.)

If the desired action type youâ€™d like to incentivize is currently not supported on Boost, you can make a request by filling out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrLVU8kSFnJPLjNn).

To start, read the documentation on [how to build a plugin](broken-reference). If you have questions or need additional support, please [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/gdu3EpeqsD).
