# FAQ

**What networks does Boost support?**

Actions can currently be tracked on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync. Rewards can be distributed on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum. If you’d like to add support for a new network, please fill out this request form.

**Can you support offchain action types?**

Boost Protocol only supports onchain actions to maintain full transparency. A few of the action types that are currently supported are swap, deposit, stake, delegate, mint, bridge and derivatives trades.

**What rewards can I distribute on Boost?**

Only ERC20 rewards can be used on Boost at this time, but we’ll be adding support for ERC1155 and onchain points soon.

**What are the fees or costs of deploying a boost?**

Boost takes a 10% fee, which is split onchain with the Boost Guild, a high quality group of contributors, and the affiliate that drives the Boost, aligning incentives between all parties. Learn more about the [Protocol Fees](../../protocol-concepts/protocol-fees.md).

**Where does the boost appear once it deploys?**

When the boost is deployed, it appears on the ecosystem of Boost Client apps such as Boost Inbox. Learn more about [Boost Client](../../overview/how-it-works/boost-clients.md) apps.

**Can I cancel or pause a boost I deployed?**

If you issued a boost and need to stop it, you can use Etherscan to pause the contract. Once successful, you should be able to see the status of the boost on the details page as ‘paused’.

**What if not all the token rewards were distributed at the end of the boost?**

If there are any tokens left in the contract once the boost has expired, you can easily withdraw the unused funds by heading the the Details Page of the boost. The same applies for unused funds from the Protocol Fee deposit. Learn more about [how to withdraw funds](withdrawing-funds.md).

**Why is no one completing my boost?**

There are many reasons why your boost may not be getting any transactions. One of the most common reasons is due to high gas fees. When network activity is up, users will have to pay more gas to transact. In this case, you may want to increase the boost reward amount to cover gas fees at minimum. Another common reason for poor boost performance may be related to incorrect audience targeting. You want to make sure that your boost is targeting the right users by leveraging the preset allowlists on Boost Manager or uploading your own CSV list.
