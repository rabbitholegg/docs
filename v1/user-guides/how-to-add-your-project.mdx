title: 'How to Add Your Project to the Boost Registry'
---

To deploy incentives for a specific project on Boost, the project must integrate with Boost Protocol. Once your project has been approved, it will be added to the [Boost Registry](https://manager.boost.xyz/registry) and will be made available on Boost Manager.

The following are some requirements to integrate your project with Boost Protocol:

* **Actions must be onchain**
* Supported on one or more of the following networks: Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Ethereum, Zora, zkSync, Mantle, Blast, Degen, Cyber
* Use a supported [ActionType](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/questdk/blob/main/src/actions/types.ts#L125)

If the desired action type or project youâ€™d like to incentivize is currently not supported on Boost, you can make a request by filling out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrLVU8kSFnJPLjNn).
