The [Boost Client SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rabbitholegg/questdk) makes it easy to leverage Boostâ€™s functionality to create a custom frontend application. [The main Boost App](https://boost.xyz/) is an example of a Boost Client that will soon be open-sourced.

*Further documentation coming soon!*
