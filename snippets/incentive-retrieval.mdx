### `clawbackFromTarget`

The clawback function allows authorized users (admin or manager) to reclaim assets from a Boost's incentive back to its associated budget. 

<Info>
  The amount reclaimed will be subject to protocol fee collection, so attempting to reclaim an amount where `reclaimAmount + calculatedProtocolFee > incentiveBalance` will revert with an `InsufficientFunds` error.
</Info>

<Warning>
  For `ERC20Incentive`, the amount specified in the clawback data must be an exact multiple of the reward value set in the incentive. Otherwise, the transaction will fail.
</Warning>

Depending on the type of incentive, calculating the clawback amount will be different.

<Tip>
  Using `clawbackFromTarget` will modify the amount of the asset marked as distributed via the budget.

#### Parameters

<ParamField path="target" type="address" required>
  The address of the contract implementing `clawback`, typically the Boost Core contract address.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="data" type="Hex" required>

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="boostId" type="bigint | number" required>
  The ID of the Boost containing the target incentive.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="incentiveId" type="bigint | number" required>

</ParamField>

<WriteParams />

#### Returns

<ResponseField name="Promise<[amount, Address]>" type="Promise<[amount, Address]>">
  Returns a tuple containing:
  - The amount that was successfully clawed back
  - The address of the token that was retrieved
</ResponseField>
