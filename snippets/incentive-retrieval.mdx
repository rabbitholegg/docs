### `clawbackFromTarget`

The clawback function allows authorized users (admin or manager) to reclaim assets from a Boost's incentive back to its associated budget. 

<Info>
  The amount reclaimed will be subject to protocol fee collection, so attempting to reclaim an amount where `reclaimAmount + calculatedProtocolFee > incentiveBalance` will revert with an `InsufficientFunds` error.
</Info>

<Warning>
  For `ERC20Incentive`, the amount specified in the clawback data must be an exact multiple of the reward value set in the incentive. Otherwise, the transaction will fail.
</Warning>

Depending on the type of incentive, calculating the clawback amount will be different.

<CodeGroup>
```ts erc20-incentive.ts
// Example for fixed-reward ERC20 incentives
const boost = await core.getBoost(0n)
const budget = boost.budget
const incentiveIndex = 0
const incentive = boost.incentives.at(incentiveIndex)

if (incentive instanceof ERC20Incentive) {
  // Calculate exact amount to clawback based on remaining claims
  const remainingClaims = await incentive.getRemainingClaimPotential()
  const rewardValue = await incentive.reward()
  const clawbackAmount = remainingClaims * rewardValue

  await budget.clawbackFromTarget(
    core.assertValidAddress(), // instruct the budget to retrieve assets from a Boost via the Boost Core contract
    incentive.buildClawbackData(clawbackAmount), // Encodes an amount to retrieve
    boost.id, // The Boost's ID
    incentiveIndex // The index of the desired incentive
  );
}
```

```ts variable-incentives.ts
// Example for variable-reward incentives
const boost = await core.getBoost(0n)
const budget = boost.budget
const incentiveIndex = 0
const incentive = boost.incentives.at(incentiveIndex)

if (incentive instanceof ERC20VariableIncentive ||
    incentive instanceof ERC20VariableCriteriaIncentive) {
  // For variable incentives, we can directly get the remaining claimable amount
  const remainingFunds = await incentive.getRemainingClaimPotential()

  await budget.clawbackFromTarget(
    core.assertValidAddress(), // instruct the budget to retrieve assets from a Boost via the Boost Core contract
    incentive.buildClawbackData(remainingFunds), // Encodes an amount to retrieve
    boost.id, // The Boost's ID
    incentiveIndex // The index of the desired incentive
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Using `clawbackFromTarget` will modify the amount of the asset marked as distributed via the budget.

#### Parameters

<ParamField path="target" type="address" required>
  The address of the contract implementing `clawback`, typically the Boost Core contract address.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="data" type="Hex" required>
  The encoded clawback data payload. Generate this using `incentive.buildClawbackData(amount)`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="boostId" type="bigint | number" required>
  The ID of the Boost containing the target incentive.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="incentiveId" type="bigint | number" required>
  The index of the incentive to clawback from.
</ParamField>

<WriteParams />

#### Returns

<ResponseField name="Promise<[amount, Address]>" type="Promise<[amount, Address]>">
  Returns a tuple containing:
  - The amount that was successfully clawed back
  - The address of the token that was retrieved
</ResponseField>
