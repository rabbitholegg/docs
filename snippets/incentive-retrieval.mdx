### `clawbackFromTarget`

The clawback function is used to reclaim assets from a Boost's incentive back to the associated budget. Can only be called by owner or admin.

<Info>
  The amount reclaimed will be subject to protocol fee collection, so attempting to reclaim an amount where `reclaimAmount + calculatedProtocolFee > incentiveBalance` will revert with an `InsufficientFunds` error.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts
const boost = await core.getBoost(0n)
const budget = boost.budget
const erc20IncentiveIndex = 0
const erc20Incentive = boost.incentives.at(erc20IncentiveIndex)

await budget.clawbackFromTarget(
  core.assertValidAddress(), // instruct the budget to retrieve assets from a Boost via the Boost Core contract
  erc20Incentive.buildClawbackData(1n), // Encodes an amount to retrieve
  boost.id, // The Boost's ID
  erc20IncentiveIndex // The index of the desired incentive
);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Using `clawbackFromTarget` will modify the amount of the asset marked as distributed via the budget.
</Tip>

#### Parameters

<ParamField path="target" type="address" required>
  The address of the contract implementing `clawback`, this should typically be Boost Core's address.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="data" type="Hex" required>
  An ABI encoded payload, typically `uint256`, representing the amount to reclaim. You can acquire this data with `incentive.buildClawbackData(amount)`
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="target" type="bigint | number" required>
  The id of the Boost containing the incentive from which to retrieve assets.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="incentiveId" type="bigint | number" required>
  The index of the incentive from which to retrieve assets.
</ParamField>

<WriteParams />

#### Returns

<ResponseField name="Promise<[amount, Address]>" type="Promise<[amount, Address]>">
  Returns the amount retrieved from the incentive, as well as the address of the underlying asset.
