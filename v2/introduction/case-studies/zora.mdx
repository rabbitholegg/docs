# Case Study #1: Zora - Accelerating Creator Onboarding

Zora, a leading NFT creation and marketplace platform, leveraged Boost to dramatically increase the number of new creators minting their first NFTs on the platform.

## Challenge

Zora wanted to lower the barrier to entry for new creators and accelerate the growth of their creator community.

## Solution

Implemented a Boost campaign that rewarded new creators for minting their first NFT on Zora. The campaign offered a tiered reward structure:

- First-time minters received a base reward in ETH.
- Additional rewards were given for minters who achieved certain milestones (e.g., first sale, multiple mints).

## Results

- 300% increase in new creator sign-ups within the first month
- 250% growth in first-time NFT mints
- 40% of new creators went on to mint multiple NFTs
- Significant increase in platform engagement and secondary market activity

## Testimonial

> "Boost has been a game-changer for Zora. It allowed us to directly incentivize the actions that matter most to our platform's growth – new creators minting their first NFTs. The flexibility of Boost meant we could fine-tune our incentives in real-time, optimizing for maximum impact. We've seen an incredible surge in creative energy and new talent on Zora as a result."
