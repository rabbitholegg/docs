title: Get Claim Signature
description: How to retrieve a signature required for claiming boost incentives
---

The Boost API provides two methods to get the required signature for claiming boost incentives:
1. Using a specific transaction hash via the [GET /signatures endpoint](/v2/api-reference/signatures/get-signature)
2. Checking recent transactions for an address via the [GET /transactions endpoint](/v2/api-reference/signatures/get-transactions)

<Note>
  In order to produce a valid signature, the transaction must meet the boost's requirements and the transaction must occur after the boost was created.
</Note>

## Fetching Signature by Transaction Hash

If you know the specific transaction that completed the boost's required action, you can fetch the signature directly:

```typescript
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  txHash: '0x2dfc8f4f24b1a3a7ee73ea13b8a20a63fe7457d1c96b95178d3ea4126b6bf5ad',
  boostId: '8453:12'
});

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api-v2.boost.xyz/signatures?${params.toString()}`
);
const { signature, claimant, incentiveId } = await response.json();
```

### Required Parameters for /signatures
- `txHash`: The transaction hash that completed the boost's required action
- `boostId`: The ID of the boost (format: `chainId:boostNumber`)
- `claimData`: (Optional) Additional data required for variable incentive types

### Response
```typescript
{
    "signature": "0x...",   // Signature for verification
    "claimant": "0x...",    // Address eligible to claim
    "incentiveId": 0        // ID of the claimable incentive
}
```

<Tip>
  For complete API details including all available parameters and response fields, see the [API Reference](/v2/api-reference/boosts/validate-&-sign-data-for-a-claim).
</Tip>

## Fetching Signature by Address

If you want to check if a wallet has completed the boost requirements, you can scan their recent transactions:

```typescript
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  address: '0x1234...', // The wallet address to check
  boostId: '8453:12'    // The boost ID to validate against
});

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api-v2.boost.xyz/transactions?${params.toString()}`
);
const { signature, claimant, incentiveId } = await response.json();
```

This endpoint will:
1. Check the last 25 transactions for the provided address
2. Validate if any transaction meets the boost's requirements
3. Return the signature response if a qualifying transaction is found

<Warning>
  The transactions endpoint is rate-limited to 1 request every 100ms. Please implement appropriate retry logic in your application.
</Warning>

### Required Parameters for /transactions
- `address`: The wallet address to check (format: `0x...`)
- `boostId`: The ID of the boost (format: `chainId:boostNumber`)

### Response
```typescript
{
    "signature": "0x...",   // Signature for verification
    "claimant": "0x...",    // Address eligible to claim
    "incentiveId": 0        // ID of the claimable incentive
}
```

## Using the Signature

Once you have the signature from either endpoint, you can use it with the following SDK methods to claim your boost:
- [BoostCore.claimIncentive](/v2/boost-sdk/boost-core/claim-incentive#claimincentive) - Claim for the transaction sender
- [BoostCore.claimIncentiveFor](/v2/boost-sdk/boost-core/claim-incentive#claimincentivefor) - Claim on behalf of another address
