### Peer Dependencies

Reward Kit is designed to work with React 18 and 19, and has no other dependencies.

```
"react": ">=18.0.0",
"react-dom": ">=18.0.0"
```

### CSP Configuration for Boost API

If you have a strict CSP policy, you may have to explicitly allow `https://api-v2.boost.xyz`, and if you're targeting testnets; `https://api-v2-staging.boost.xyz`

For example, you can configure your headers as follows:

```
Content-Security-Policy: connect-src https://api-v2.boost.xyz https://api-v2-staging.boost.xyz/;
// or
Content-Security-Policy: default-src https://api-v2.boost.xyz https://api-v2-staging.boost.xyz/;
```

### Runtime Requirements

Reward Kit is optimized for modern browsers. It is compatible with the following browser configurations:

```
Chrome >= 87
Firefox >= 78
Edge >= 88
Safari >= 14
```

> If you want to support older browsers, you need to transpile the library from `node_modules` yourselves.
