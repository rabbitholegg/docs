Choosing the right action for your Boost is crucial. It determines what on-chain behavior you're incentivizing. This guide will help you understand the process of action selection and how to effectively use Etherscan data to set up your Boost.

## What is Action Selection?

Action selection is the process of defining the specific on-chain behavior you want to incentivize with your Boost. This could be anything from token transfers and swaps to liquidity provision or NFT minting.

## Why is Action Selection Important?

1. **Targeted Incentives**: Properly selected actions ensure you're rewarding the exact behavior you want to encourage.
2. **Efficient Resource Use**: Well-defined actions help you allocate your rewards more effectively.
3. **User Engagement**: Clear, relevant actions can drive higher participation in your Boost campaign.

## Key Components of Action Selection

1. **Contract Address**: The specific smart contract you're targeting.
2. **Function Signature**: The particular function within the contract that represents the action.
3. **Parameter Filters**: Conditions on the function parameters to further refine the action.
4. **Log Filters**: Filters based on events emitted during the transaction.
5. **Claimant Information**: Identifying who should receive the reward for the action.

In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into how to gather this information from Etherscan and use it to set up effective Boost actions.
