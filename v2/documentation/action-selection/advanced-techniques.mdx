As you become more comfortable with setting up basic Boost actions, you can explore more advanced techniques to create highly targeted and effective Boosts.

## 1. Combining Filters

Use both function parameters and log events to create very specific targets.

**Example**: Target large swaps that result in a minimum output amount
- Use function parameters to filter for a minimum input amount
- Use log events to filter for a minimum output amount

## 2. Time-Based Boosts

Use the transaction timestamp to create time-limited promotions.

**Example**: Reward actions only during a specific timeframe
- Set up a filter based on the block timestamp
- This can be useful for short-term promotions or to align with specific events

## 3. Multi-Step Actions

For complex DeFi strategies, consider creating multiple Boosts that reward users for completing a series of actions.

**Example**: Reward users for providing liquidity and then staking their LP tokens
- Create one Boost for the liquidity provision action
- Create another Boost for the staking action
- Users who complete both actions get rewards from both Boosts

## 4. Dynamic Adjustments

Regularly review your Boost performance and be prepared to adjust your filters.

**Example**: If market conditions change, you might need to adjust your "large transfer" threshold
- Monitor the number of qualifying actions
- Adjust your filters if you're getting too many or too few qualifying actions

## 5. Exclusion Filters

Use filters to exclude certain addresses or types of transactions.

**Example**: Exclude known contract addresses or team wallets from claiming rewards
- Set up a filter to exclude specific addresses
- This can help prevent gaming of the system and ensure rewards go to genuine users

## 6. Composite Actions

Create Boosts that reward users for performing multiple actions in a single transaction.

**Example**: Reward users who swap tokens and then provide liquidity in the same transaction
- Set up filters to check for both a swap event and a liquidity provision event
- This can incentivize more complex and valuable user behaviors

Remember, with advanced techniques comes increased complexity. Always thoroughly test your Boost configurations before deploying them, and be prepared to make adjustments based on real-world performance.
