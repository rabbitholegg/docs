Boost V2 supports a wide range of tokens for rewards, allowing you to incentivize actions with various cryptocurrencies. This flexibility enables you to align your rewards with your project's ecosystem or user preferences.

## Supported Token Types

- **Native Tokens**: ETH, MATIC, etc.
- **ERC-20 Tokens**: USDC, DAI, LINK, etc.
- **Custom Tokens**: Your project's native token

## Adding New Tokens

If you don't see a token you want to use, you can request to add it to our supported list. The process involves:

1. Submitting a token request
2. Our team reviewing the token for security and compatibility
3. Integration of the approved token into the Boost V2 system

## Best Practices

- Choose tokens that align with your target audience
- Consider liquidity and ease of transfer when selecting reward tokens
- Balance between popular tokens and your project's native tokens for optimal engagement
