Designing an effective reward distribution strategy is crucial for the success of your Boost campaign. Here are some strategies to consider:

## Fixed Reward Amount

- Set a fixed amount of tokens for each qualifying action
- Pros: Simple to understand and implement
- Cons: May not scale well with varying transaction sizes

## Percentage-Based Rewards

- Reward users with a percentage of their transaction value
- Pros: Scales with transaction size, incentivizes larger actions
- Cons: More complex to implement, potential for very large rewards

## Streamed Rewards

- Distribute rewards gradually over time after the action is completed
- Pros: Encourages long-term engagement and retention
- Cons: Delayed gratification might be less appealing to some users

## Gas Rebate Rewards

- Reimburse users for the gas fees incurred during the qualifying action
- Pros: Removes a barrier to participation, especially during high gas periods
- Cons: Gas prices can be volatile, potentially leading to unpredictable reward amounts

When choosing a strategy, consider your goals, budget, and target audience. It's often effective to combine multiple strategies for optimal results. For example, you could offer a fixed reward plus a gas rebate, or a percentage-based reward with a streaming component.

Remember to clearly communicate your chosen reward strategy to users, ensuring they understand how and when they'll receive their rewards. This transparency can significantly boost participation and user satisfaction.
