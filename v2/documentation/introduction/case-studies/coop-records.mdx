# Case Study #2: Coop Records - Amplifying Music NFT Releases

Coop Records, an innovative music NFT platform, used Boost to supercharge the minting of new music releases, rapidly climbing leaderboard rankings.

## Challenge

Coop Records wanted to increase the visibility and minting volume of new music NFT releases, especially from emerging artists.

- Additional bonuses were offered for users who minted multiple NFTs from the same artist or across different artists.

## Results
