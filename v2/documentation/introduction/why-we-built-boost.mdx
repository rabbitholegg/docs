The development of Boost stems from a series of observations about blockchain technology's potential to reshape economic interactions. Here's our condensed thinking:

## 1. Evolving Ownership and Incentive Models

The concept of user-owned networks isn't new, but blockchain offers an unprecedented opportunity to scale this model globally. Simultaneously, the ability to programmatically incentivize specific behaviors provides a new lever for social and economic engineering.

Boost combines these ideas, creating a framework for dynamic, contribution-based ownership distribution that more accurately reflects user value creation. It's not just an incremental improvement—it's a fundamental rethinking of how network value can be allocated and how behavior can be shaped at scale.

## 2. Modular Infrastructure for Economic Experimentation

Throughout history, modular, composable systems have fostered rapid innovation. Think of how standardized shipping containers revolutionized global trade, or how open-source software accelerated development.

We've designed Boost as modular infrastructure for the next generation of blockchain-based systems. By providing a standardized yet flexible system for incentive design, easily integrated into any blockchain project, we aim to catalyze a new wave of experimentation in decentralized systems.

## 3. Democratizing and Iterating on Economic Design

Historically, experimenting with incentive design has been challenging. It often felt like guesswork, requiring commitment to a single mechanism without the ability to easily iterate. Incentive design, much like game design, is a hybrid of art and science, where new metas emerge as participants optimize their strategies.

Boost aims to democratize this capability while addressing these challenges. It allows for rapid experimentation and iteration in incentive design, enabling a much broader group to participate in shaping economic systems. Crucially, Boost is built with the understanding that to solve the sybil issue, the rules of the game must be dynamic and partially obscured, allowing for continuous evolution of the incentive landscape.

## Our Vision

In essence, Boost is our attempt to provide foundational infrastructure for reimagining ownership, incentives, and economic design in the blockchain era. If successful, it could facilitate more efficient and equitable economic systems, enable new forms of global cooperation, and accelerate the overall development of blockchain technology.

We're still in the early stages of understanding how programmable incentives and dynamic ownership distribution can reshape our economic landscape. Boost is our contribution to this exploration—a tool to help us collectively navigate this new territory and unlock the tremendous potential that blockchain technology promises.
