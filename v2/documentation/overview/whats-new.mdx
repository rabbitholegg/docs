## Budget Accounts

Boost V2 introduces the concept of budget accounts, which are smart accounts used to store and manage funds for boost creation. Having a budget account is mandatory for deploying boosts. Budget accounts offer several key features:

- Team management with role-based access control
- Fund management and deployment controls
- Automated boost deployment

## Flexible Integration with Any Contract Function or Event

V2 significantly enhances integration capabilities by allowing boosts to target any contract function or event, offering much greater versatility compared to the action-based structure of Boost V1.

## Variable Reward Structure

Along with fixed rewards from Boost V1, V2 introduces a highly flexible variable rewards system that adjusts incentives based on a wide range of external factors. This allows partners to create dynamic reward structures that respond to market conditions, user behaviors, and other predefined metrics.
