title: "The Vision of Boost"
description: "Redefining Network Participation and Ownership"
---

The long-term vision for Boost extends far beyond its current implementation. We're building a decentralized network that fundamentally reimagines how ownership of digital networks is distributed and how participation is incentivized.

## A Paradigm Shift in Network Growth

Historically, new networks have relied on traditional marketing channels to attract participants. Boost proposes a paradigm shift: instead of marketing on social media, networks will deploy targeted incentives that promote specific on-chain transactions. This approach not only attracts participants but ensures they're the right ones – those who actively contribute to the network's value.

## The Future of AI and On-Chain Transactions

Looking further ahead, we anticipate a future where AI agents, acting on behalf of humans, become the primary actors in on-chain transactions. In this context, Boost aims to become for agents what ad networks were for humans – a critical infrastructure for discovering and engaging with valuable network activities.

## Solving the Network Bootstrapping Problem

This vision of Boost represents a novel approach to solving the network bootstrapping problem that has challenged many blockchain projects. By creating a decentralized, programmable incentive layer, we're not just helping individual networks find participants; we're building a meta-network that could reshape how all digital networks grow and distribute ownership.

## Profound Implications

The implications of this are profound. If successful, Boost could:

- Accelerate the adoption of truly user-owned networks
- Create more efficient markets for digital participation
- Influence the evolution of AI agents by shaping the incentive landscapes they navigate

## An Ongoing Exploration

As with many ambitious projects, the full ramifications of Boost are yet to be understood. We're at the beginning of exploring how programmable, on-chain incentives can reshape digital economies. Boost is our contribution to this exploration – a tool for collective experimentation in the future of network ownership and participation.
