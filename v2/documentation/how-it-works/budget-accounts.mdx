Budget accounts are a fundamental component of Boost V2 that enable secure and controlled distribution of reward tokens. 
They act as smart-contract powered treasuries that hold and manage the funds used for your boost campaigns.

<Note>
  Budget accounts are required to deploy boosts. Make sure to fund your budget account with enough tokens to cover your reward strategy.
</Note>

## Overview

Budget accounts use a role-based access control system to manage permissions and fund distribution. 
Here are the key features of budget accounts:

### Role-Based Access Control

Budget accounts implement a robust role-based access control system that allows for secure and organized team management of funds.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Managers">
    The Manager role is designed for team members who need to create and manage boost campaigns. Managers can:
    
    - Deploy new boost campaigns using budget funds
    - Monitor and track fund usage
    - Manage and disburse funds
    
    <Warning>
      Managers have significant control over fund distribution, so this role should only be granted to trusted team members.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Admins">
    The Admin role is designed for team members who need complete control over the budget. 
    Admins have the ability to manage funds and deploy boosts, plus additional control over:

    - Granting and revoking team member roles
    - Managing account permissions
    - Recovering funds using clawback functionality
    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Analytics

The analytics dashboard shows key metrics including total rewards distributed, available balance, and total funds allocated across all boosts, 
with more detailed analytics coming soon.

## Deploy and Configure Your Budget Account

To deploy a budget account, navigate to the [Boost V2 interface](https://beta.boost.xyz) and connect your wallet. 

After connecting your wallet, you'll be taken to your dashboard where you can create a new budget account.

Click the "Create Budget" button and fill in the budget details including Display Name and Deployment Network.

<Note>
  You will need to make a budget account for each chain you wish to deploy funds from.
</Note>

After filling in the details, click the "Deploy" button.

### Adding Funds

After deploying your budget account, add funds by navigating to the tokens tab and clicking "Deposit".
This opens a modal where you can select the token and amount to deposit.

</Frame>

After depositing tokens, the amount will be reflected in your available funds and appear in the tokens list.

### Adding Team Members

Add team members by navigating to the members tab and clicking "Add Members".
From here, you can add wallet addresses and assign them either Manager or Admin roles.

<Frame caption="Members can be assigned either the Manager or Admin role">

Authorized addresses will appear in the members list with their assigned role. Admin role holders can manage and revoke roles from this view.

<Tip>
  You can use the [Boost SDK](/v2/boost-sdk/budgets/managed/overview) to deploy and interact with budget accounts programmatically.
