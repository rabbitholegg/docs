# How to Deploy a Boost: A High-Level Guide

Deploying a boost on Boost V2 is a straightforward process that allows you to incentivize specific on-chain actions. Follow these steps to create your boost:

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  You will need to create or be authorized to use a [budget account](/v2/documentation/how-it-works/budget-accounts) before you can deploy boosts.
</Note>

- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet)
- A [budget account](/v2/documentation/how-it-works/budget-accounts) with sufficient tokens for rewards and gas fees
- A clear understanding of the action you want to incentivize

## How to Deploy a Boost

<Tip>
  You can use the [Boost SDK](/v2/boost-sdk/boost-core/create-boost) to deploy boosts programmatically.
</Tip>

<Steps titleSize='h3'>
   <Step title="Connect Your Wallet" stepNumber={1}>
      - Visit the Boost V2 platform (https://beta.boost.xyz)
      - Click on "Connect Wallet" and choose your preferred wallet provider
      - Ensure you're connected to the correct network (e.g., Optimism, Base)
   </Step>

   <Step title="Navigate to the Deploy Flow" stepNumber={2}>
      Once connected, you will be directed to your dashboard. From here, look for the deploy button in the top right. This will open the deploy flow page.

   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure the Boost Action" stepNumber={3}>
      Boost V2 is very flexible in that you can target any action that has a valid event or function signature. In the example 
      below, we will target the `mint` function on the `ZoraTimedSaleStrategy` contract.

      Once you have selected the contract and signature, you can further refine the action by setting parameters based on the function or events arguments.
      In our example we are targeting a specific collection and tokenId for a NFT mint on [Zora](https://zora.co/trending).

      This means that anyone who mints an NFT from this collection with the specified tokenId will be eligible for a reward.

   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure the Action Claimant" stepNumber={4}>
      In Boost V1, the action claimant was always the address who submitted the action (msg.sender). In Boost V2, we have added more flexibility to allow the claimant to be an address that is available in a function or event argument.
      This allows for compatibility with account-abstraction wallets and other scenarios where the transaction does not originate from the claimant's wallet.

      In our example, we will set the claimant to be the `mintTo` address from the mint function signature. This means that the account that receives the minted NFT also receives the reward.

      </Frame>
   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure the Reward Structure" stepNumber={5}>
      Boost V2 allows you to configure static rewards, which you'll be familiar with from Boost V1, as well as dynamic rewards based on on-chain criteria.
      To begin, select a budget account and reward token from the "Reward Token" dropdown. All budget accounts you are authorized to use will show in the dropdown.
      If you do not have a budget account setup yet, you can follow our guide [here](/v2/documentation/how-it-works/budget-accounts).

      <Tip>
         Only whitelisted tokens will show in the deploy flow. If you don't see the token you want to use, you can request to add it to our [supported tokens list](/v2/documentation/reward-selection/tokens-supported).
      </Tip>
      
      <Tabs>
         <Tab title="Fixed Rewards">
            Fixed rewards are similar to rewards in Boost V1. You set a reward amount per action and the total budget for the boost.

            - **Spend Limit**: The maximum amount of tokens you are willing to spend on this boost.
            - **Reward Amount**: The amount of tokens you will give to each eligible claimant.

            <Frame caption="Configuring Static Rewards">
               <img src="/assets/deploy/deploy-fixedreward.png" alt="Deploy Boost Static Rewards" />
            </Frame>
         </Tab>
         <Tab title="Dynamic Rewards">
            Dynamic rewards let you calculate reward amounts based on on-chain criteria. For example, you can reward 2 tokens per NFT minted (using the `quantity` argument), up to a maximum of 10 tokens per claimant.

            - **Spend Limit**: The maximum amount of tokens you are willing to spend on this boost.
            - **Max Reward**: The maximum amount of tokens that can be earned per claimant.
            - **Dynamic Reward Filter**: The on-chain criteria that determines how many tokens a claimant will receive. This is set similar to how we configure the action.
            Choose a contract function or event, and use one of the arguments to determine how many tokens a claimant will receive. In our example we are using the `quantity` argument from the mint function and giving 2 tokens for each NFT minted, up to the max reward.
            So if a claimant mints 5 or more NFTs, they will receive the max reward of 10 tokens, otherwise they will receive 2 tokens per NFT minted.

            </Frame>
         </Tab>
      </Tabs>
   </Step>

   <Step title="Review the Activity Preview" stepNumber={6}>
      Before deploying your boost, review the activity preview to ensure your configuration is correct:

      <Frame caption="Activity Preview">
      <img src="/assets/deploy/deploy-activity.png" alt="Deploy Boost Preview" />
      </Frame>

      The preview shows recent on-chain activity that matches your configured action, helping you verify:
      - Action parameters are correctly set
      - Claimant addresses are being captured
      - Reward calculations are as intended

      <Note>
      Always verify transactions on a block explorer to ensure your boost targets exactly what you want to incentivize.
      </Note>
   </Step>

   <Step title="Deploy the Boost" stepNumber={7}>
      Once you have configured the boost, you can deploy it by clicking the "Deploy Boost" button. Once it is deployed, you can monitor the boost's performance and manage it from your budget account dashboard.
   </Step>
</Steps>

### Next Steps
After deploying your boost:
1. Share the boost details with your community
2. Monitor performance in your dashboard
3. Make adjustments based on activity
4. Consider creating additional boosts for different actions
