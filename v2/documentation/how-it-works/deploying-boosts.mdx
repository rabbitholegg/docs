# How to Deploy a Boost on Boost V2: A High-Level Guide

Deploying a boost on Boost V2 is a straightforward process that allows you to incentivize specific on-chain actions. Follow these steps to create your boost:

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  You will need to create or be authorized to use a [budget account](/v2/documentation/how-it-works/budget-accounts) before you can deploy boosts.
</Note>

- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet)
- A [budget account](/v2/documentation/how-it-works/budget-accounts) with sufficient tokens for rewards and gas fees
- A clear understanding of the action you want to incentivize

## How to Deploy a Boost

<Tip>
  You can use the [Boost SDK](/v2/boost-sdk/boost-core/create-boost) to deploy boosts programmatically.
</Tip>

<Steps titleSize='h3'>
   <Step title="Connect Your Wallet" stepNumber={1}>
      - Visit the Boost V2 platform (https://beta.boost.xyz)
      - Click on "Connect Wallet" and choose your preferred wallet provider
      - Ensure you're connected to the correct network (e.g., Optimism, Base)
   </Step>

   <Step title="Navigate to the Deploy Flow" stepNumber={2}>
      Once connected, you will be directed to your dashboard. From here, look for the deploy button in the top right. This will open the deploy flow page.

   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure the Boost Action" stepNumber={3}>
      Boost V2 is very flexible in that you can target any action that has a valid event or function signature. In the example 
      below, we will target the `mint` function on the `ZoraTimedSaleStrategy` contract.

      Once you have selected the contract and signature, you can further refine the action by setting parameters based on the function or events arguments.
      In our example we are targeting a specific collection and tokenId for a NFT mint on [Zora](https://zora.co/trending).

      This means that anyone who mints an NFT from this collection with the specified tokenId will be eligible for a reward.

   </Step>

   <Step title="Configure the Action Claimant" stepNumber={4}>
      In Boost V1, the action claimant was always the address who submitted the action (msg.sender). In Boost V2, we have added more flexibility to allow the claimant to be an address that is available in a function or event argument.
      This allows for compatibility with account-abstraction wallets and other scenarios where the transaction does not originate from the claimant's wallet.

      In our example, we will set the claimant to be the `mintTo` address from the mint function signature. This means that the account that receives the minted NFT also receives the reward.

   </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
   You will see a preview of the parameters you set for your action where you can verify that the action and claimant are set correctly. Any recent actitivy that matches the configured action will appear here. 
   You can check the actiivty on a block explorer to make sure it matches what you want to incentivize.

{/* 4. **Select or Input Contract Details**
   - Choose a pre-existing contract from popular protocols, or
   - Input a custom contract address
   - Select the specific function you want to incentivize

5. **Define the Action**
   - Specify the exact on-chain action you want to boost
   - Set any parameter conditions (e.g., minimum transaction amount)

6. **Configure Reward Structure**
   - Choose the reward token (e.g., USDC, ETH, or your own token)
   - Set the reward amount per action
   - Define the total budget for the boost from your selected budget account

7. **Set Boost Duration**
   - Choose a start date and time
   - Set an end date or total action limit

8. **Review and Confirm**
   - Double-check all details of your boost
   - Ensure your budget account has sufficient funds for the total boost budget

9. **Deploy the Boost**
   - Click "Deploy Boost"
   - Confirm the transaction in your wallet

10. **Monitor and Manage**
    - Once deployed, you can monitor your boost's performance
    - Adjust parameters or top up the budget account as needed */}

## Key Considerations

- Ensure you have enough gas tokens (e.g., ETH) to cover deployment costs
- If you don't have a budget account, you can create one during the deployment process
- Consider starting with a smaller budget for testing before scaling up
- Be precise in defining the action to avoid unintended reward distributions
- You can deploy multiple boosts from the same budget account
- Familiarize yourself with the Boost V2 documentation for advanced features

## Best Practices

- Clearly define your goals before creating a boost
- Align your boost strategy with your project's overall tokenomics
- Monitor your boost's performance and adjust as needed
- Communicate the boost details clearly to your community
- Consider the potential impact on your token's economics and user behavior

Remember, each boost targets a specific, verifiable on-chain action. Design your boost carefully to align with your project's goals and tokenomics.
