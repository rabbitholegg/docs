To begin creating your Boost action, you'll need to gather information from Etherscan. Here's how to get started:

1. Go to [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/)
2. In the search bar at the top, paste a transaction hash (a long string of letters and numbers)
3. Press Enter or click the search icon

You'll now see a page full of information about the transaction. In the following sections, we'll go through each part step by step, with examples to help you recognize what you're looking at.

Remember, the goal is to understand the transaction details so you can accurately define the on-chain behavior you want to incentivize with your Boost.
