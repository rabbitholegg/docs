The Logs section on Etherscan provides valuable information about events that occurred during the transaction. This information can be used to create more precise Boost actions.

## Finding the Logs Section

Scroll down to the "Logs" section on Etherscan. Each log represents an event that happened during the transaction.

## Components of a Log

### Address

- The contract address is shown at the top of each log
- **Example**: Address: 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 (USDC token contract)
- **How to use it**: Enter this address in the "Address" field of the Log Filter in the Boost Deploy flow

### Signature

- The event name is shown if the contract is verified
- **Example**: Event: Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)
- **How to use it**: Select this event (e.g., "Transfer") in the "Signature" dropdown of the Log Filter

### Parameter Filters

Below the event name, you'll see a list of parameters and their values.

#### Example for a Transfer event:

```
from (address): 0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D
to (address): 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F
value (uint256): 1000000000000000000 (1 Token)
```

#### Example for a Swap event:
