As you become more comfortable with creating Boost actions, consider these advanced techniques and best practices.

## Advanced Strategies

1. **Combining Filters**: Use both function parameters and log events for very specific targeting
2. **Time-Based Boosts**: Create time-limited promotions using transaction timestamps
3. **Multi-Step Actions**: Reward users for completing a series of actions
4. **Dynamic Adjustments**: Regularly review and adjust your filters based on performance

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic filters and gradually add complexity
2. **Balance Specificity and Reach**: Very specific filters might result in few qualifying transactions
3. **Consider the User**: Design filters that align with desired user behavior
4. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with developments in the protocols you're targeting
5. **Learn from Others**: Study successful boosts in similar categories
6. **Consider Chain Specifics**: Be aware of differences across multiple chains
7. **Align with Project Goals**: Ensure your chosen actions support overall objectives

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If your boost isn't performing as expected, review your filters for potential issues
- Use the "Filter Preview" feature extensively to test your configurations
- Consider the current market conditions and user behavior when analyzing performance

Remember, creating effective Boost actions is an iterative process. Don't be afraid to experiment and refine your approach based on the results you see.
