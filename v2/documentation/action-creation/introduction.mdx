## Action vs. Reward

Before we dive in, it's important to understand the distinction between actions and rewards in the Boost ecosystem:

- **Action**: The on-chain behavior you want to incentivize (e.g., "Swap at least 100 USDC for ETH on Uniswap V3")
- **Reward**: What users receive for completing the action (e.g., "5 PROJECT_TOKEN for each qualifying swap")

This guide focuses on defining actions. Reward setup is a separate process that comes after action definition.

Let's begin by learning how to navigate Etherscan to find the information you need.
