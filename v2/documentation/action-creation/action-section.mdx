---

The Action section on Etherscan provides key information about the transaction. Let's break down the main components:

## From

- **Where to find it**: Look for "From:" near the top of the Etherscan page
- **What it is**: The address that sent the transaction
- **Example**: From: 0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D
- **How to use it**: Enter this address in the "From" field of the Boost Deploy flow if you want to target transactions from a specific address or type of address (like a specific DEX router)

## To

- **Where to find it**: Look for "To:" just below "From:"
- **What it is**: The address of the contract being interacted with
- **Example**: To: 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB480xfc1f3296458f9b2a27a0b91dd7681c4020e09d05 (USDCWETH:OP UniswapV3Pool token contract)
- **How to use it**: Enter this address in the "To" field to target interactions with a specific contract (like swaps involving USDCWETH/OP)

## Value

- **Where to find it**: Look for "Value:" in the transaction details
- **What it is**: The amount of ETH sent with the transaction
- **Example**: Value: 0.1 Ether ($183.58)
- **How to use it**: You can use this to set a value filter in the Boost Deploy flow, e.g., to target only transactions above 0.1 ETH

## Signature

1. Scroll down to the "Input Data" section on Etherscan
2. If the contract is verified, you'll see a decoded function name
3. If not verified, you'll see a long string of numbers and letters
- **Example**: Function: transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)
- **How to use it**: Select this function (e.g., "transfer") in the "Signature" dropdown in the Boost Deploy flow

Understanding these components will help you accurately define the action you want to boost.
