description: "Learn how to withdraw remaining rewards from a boost using the UI or SDK"
---

You can withdraw remaining rewards from a boost either through the Boost UI or programmatically using the SDK.

### Using Boost UI

You can withdraw the remaining tokens from your boost by visiting your budget account dashboard on the Boost App. Navigate to the "Boosts" tab to see a list of boosts you have deployed. Once rewards have been withdrawn, the Boost will be considered ended/inactive.

### Using the Boost SDK

To withdraw programmatically, use the [clawbackFromTarget](/v2/boost-sdk/asset-retrieval#clawbackfromtarget) method on the budget. 

<Warning>
  For `ERC20Incentive`, the amount specified in the clawback data must be an exact multiple of the reward value set in the incentive. Otherwise, the transaction will fail.
</Warning>

Depending on the type of incentive, calculating the clawback amount will be different.

    ```ts
    // Example for fixed-reward ERC20 incentives
    const boost = await core.getBoost(0n)
    const budget = boost.budget

    const incentive = boost.incentives.at(incentiveIndex)

    if (incentive instanceof ERC20Incentive) {
      // Calculate exact amount to clawback based on remaining claims
      const remainingClaims = await incentive.getRemainingClaimPotential()
      const rewardValue = await incentive.reward()
      const clawbackAmount = remainingClaims * rewardValue

      await budget.clawbackFromTarget(
        core.assertValidAddress(),
        incentive.buildClawbackData(clawbackAmount),
        boost.id,
        incentiveIndex
      );
    }

    ```ts
    // Example for variable-reward incentives
    const boost = await core.getBoost(0n)
    const budget = boost.budget
    const incentiveIndex = 0
    const incentive = boost.incentives.at(incentiveIndex)

    if (incentive instanceof ERC20VariableIncentive ||
        incentive instanceof ERC20VariableCriteriaIncentive) {
      // For variable incentives, we can directly get the remaining claimable amount
      const remainingFunds = await incentive.getRemainingClaimPotential()

      await budget.clawbackFromTarget(
        core.assertValidAddress(),
        incentive.buildClawbackData(remainingFunds),

        incentiveIndex
      );
