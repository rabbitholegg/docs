In Boost V2, a Boost remains "Active" until it runs out of rewardsâ€”either through claims or after the remaining funds have been withdrawn. To determine a Boost's active status, you can use the `canBeClaimed` method on each of the boost incentives.

```typescript
const boost = await core.getBoost(17n, { chainId: 8453 });

async function isBoostActive(incentives) {
  for (const incentive of incentives) {
    if (await incentive.canBeClaimed()) return true;
  }
  return false;
}

const active = await isBoostActive(boost.incentives);
```

<Warning>
  For variable incentive types, `canBeClaimed` only checks if the incentive balance is greater than zero. 
  This may not accurately reflect claimability if the balance is less than the minimum payout amount required for a reward.
</Warning>
