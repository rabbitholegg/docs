## Get Details for a Specific Boost

Retrieve detailed information about a specific boost using its unique identifier, which combines the chain ID and boost ID number.

<Note>
  The boostId is sequential and zero-indexed. For example, the first boost deployed on Zora (chainId: 7777777) would have the ID `7777777:0`
