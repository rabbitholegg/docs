## How to Check if a User Has Claimed a Boost

To check if a user has claimed an incentive on a boost, use the Boost SDK. Since boosts can have multiple incentives, you'll need to check each incentive individually.

```typescript
const boost = await core.getBoost(17n, { chainId: 8453 });

for (const incentive of boost.incentives) {
  const claimed = await incentive.claimed('0x...'); // address of claimant
  console.log(claimed); // true/false
}
```
