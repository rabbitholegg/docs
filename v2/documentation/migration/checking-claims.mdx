## How to Check if a User Has Claimed a Boost

The Boost SDK provides methods to verify if a user has claimed any incentives on a boost. 
Since a boost can have multiple incentives, you'll need to check the claim status of each incentive separately using the `claimed` method.

```typescript
const boost = await core.getBoost(17n, { chainId: 8453 });

for (const incentive of boost.incentives) {
  const claimed = await incentive.claimed('0x...'); // address to check
  console.log(claimed); // returns boolean
}
```
