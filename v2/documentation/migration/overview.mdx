## Key Changes

The key distinction between Boost V1 and V2 lies in their development approach. While V1 relied heavily on API interactions, V2 shifts towards direct contract interactions using the Boost SDK. 
This shift requires integrators to provide more of their own data based on the specific action they wish to implement.

- **NFT metadata is no longer included in the V2 data model.** Integrators must now obtain this information independently from other sources.
- **Reward images are not available in Boost V2.** Integrators will need to source this information themselves from alternative platforms.
