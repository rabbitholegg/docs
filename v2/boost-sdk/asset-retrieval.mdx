There are two locations assets are stored within the Boost Protocol, [budgets](/v2/boost-sdk/budgets/managed/retrieval) and [incentives](/v2/boost-sdk/incentives/erc20/overview).

Both budgets and incentives only allow authorized users to retrieve funds, requiring the sender to either be the owner, or have the [Roles.MANAGER](https://sdk.boost.xyz/enums/Roles.html#MANAGER)
