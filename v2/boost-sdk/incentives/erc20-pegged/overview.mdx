The ERC20 Pegged Incentive is a specialized protocol incentive that allows for the distribution of ERC-20 assets with rewards pegged to the value of another token. This enables creating rewards that maintain a specific value relative to a pegged asset. When users claim rewards, they receive an amount of the reward token equivalent in value to the pegged amount.

## Key Features

- Rewards pegged to the value of another token (e.g., USDC) or native chain token (e.g., ETH)
- Dynamic reward amounts based on current price ratios
- Supports any ERC20 token as the reward asset
- Total distribution limit in reward asset tokens
- Managed access for incentive control and clawbacks

<Info>
  Unlike budgets, allowlists, and validators, incentives cannot be re-used between multiple Boosts.
</Info>

<Info>
  To peg rewards to the chain's native token (e.g., ETH), use `zeroAddress` (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) as the peg parameter. This tells the protocol to use the native token's price for calculations.

### Create a new ERC20PeggedIncentive

<CodeGroup>

  ```ts index.ts
  import { BoostCore } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostCore'
  import { config } from "./config";
  import { parseUnits, zeroAddress } from 'viem'

  const core = new BoostCore({ config });

  await core.createBoost({
    maxParticipants: 10n,
    budget,
    action,
    allowList,
    incentives: [
      core.ERC20PeggedIncentive({
        asset: '0xRewardToken', // token that will be distributed
        peg: '0xPeggedToken' || zeroAddress, // token to peg the reward value to (e.g., USDC or ETH)
        reward: parseUnits("1", 6), // amount in pegged token value (e.g., 1 USDC worth)
        limit: parseUnits("1000", 18), // maximum total amount of asset token (in wei) that can be distributed as rewards
        manager: "0xManager", // address with administrative control over the incentive
      }),
    ],
  });
  ```

  <Config />
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  The manager parameter specifies an address that has administrative control over the incentive. This address can perform management operations like triggering clawbacks of undistributed rewards if needed.
</Info>

### Get an existing ERC20PeggedIncentive

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts
// if an incentive address is known, directly construct it
const incentive = core.ERC20PeggedIncentive("0xc55F719709bDad022B320E76f9DfF7e6F5680767")

// or if you want a budget from a specific chain
const incentiveOnBase = core.ERC20PeggedIncentive(
  "0xc55F719709bDad022B320E76f9DfF7e6F5680767",
  { chainId: 8453 }
)

// or accessible off of a a pre-exiting Boost
const boost = await core.getBoost(0n)
const incentive = boost.incentives.find((incentive) => incentive instanceof ERC20PeggedIncentive)
```
