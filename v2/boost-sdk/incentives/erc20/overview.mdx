import Config from '/snippets/config.mdx';

The ERC20 Incentive is an essential protocol incentive that allows for the distribution of native and ERC-20 assets, supporting raffle functionality as well as basic fixed rewards. On Boost creation, a predetermined amount of the specified asset is transferred into this incentive from the associated budget.

## Key Features

- Supports native assets as well as any ERC20
- Rewards fixed at time of creation
- Raffle functionality, with full incentive balance going to random claimant

<Info>
  Unlike budgets, allowlists, and validators, incentives cannot be re-used between multiple Boosts.

#### Create a new ERC20Incentive

**To initialize a new ERC20Incentive contract:**

<CodeGroup>

  ```ts index.ts
  import { BoostCore } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostCore'
  import { StrategyType } from '@boostxyz/sdk/claiming'
  import { config } from "./config";

  const core = new BoostCore({ config });

  await core.createBoost({
    maxParticipants: 10n,
    budget,
    action,
    allowList,
    incentives: [
      core.ERC20Incentive({
        asset: '0xERC20' || zeroAddress, // use zero address for native assets
        reward: parseEther("1"), // how much to distribute on each claim, with the RAFFLE stratgy, the total reward is `parseEther("1") * limit`
        limit: 10n, // how many times can this incentive be claimed
        strategy: StrategyType.POOL || StrategyType.RAFFLE,
        manager: budget.assertValidAddress(),
      }),
    ],
  });
  ```

  <Config />
</CodeGroup>

#### Get an existing ERC20Incentive

**To get an existing ERC20Incentive contract:**

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts
const incentive = core.ERC20Incentive("0xc55F719709bDad022B320E76f9DfF7e6F5680767")

// or if you want a budget from a specific chain
const incentiveOnBase = core.ERC20Incentive(
  "0xc55F719709bDad022B320E76f9DfF7e6F5680767",
  { chainId: 8453 }
)

// or accessible off of a a pre-exiting Boost
const boost = await core.getBoost(0n)
const incentive = boost.incentives.find(incentive => incentive instanceof ERC20Incentive)
```
</CodeGroup>
