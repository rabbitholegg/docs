description: Learn about how to interact with a Continuous Gradual Dutch Auction Incentive using the SDK
---

import Config from '/snippets/config.mdx';
import SDKDisclaimer from '/snippets/sdk-disclaimer.mdx';

The Continuous Gradual Dutch Auction Incentive is a protocol incentive that allows for rewards that adjust dynamically based on claim volume. [See this document for more information on gradual dutch auctions](https://moallemi.com/ciamac/papers/pricing-dutch-auctions-2024.pdf). On Boost creation, the incentive's total budget of the specified asset is transferred into this incentive from the associated budget.

## Key Features

- Supports native assets as well as any ERC20
- Rewards programmatically decline after each claim
- Rewards programmatically increase each hour without a claim

<Info>
  Unlike budgets, allowlists, and validators, incentives cannot be re-used between multiple Boosts.

### Create a new CGDAIncentive

<CodeGroup>

  ```ts index.ts
  import { BoostCore } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostCore'
  import { config } from "./config";

  const core = new BoostCore({ config });

  await core.createBoost({
    maxParticipants: 10n,
    budget,
    action,
    allowList,
    incentives: [
      core.CGDAIncentive({
        asset: '0xERC20', // The address of the underlying asset, or zeroAddress for native token
        initialReward: 5n, // The initial amount for the first claim
        totalBudget: 10n, // The total amount distributable by this incentive
        rewardBoost: 1n, // How much to increase the reward each hour
        rewardDecay: 1n, // How much to subtract from the reward each hour
        manager: '0xBUDGET_ADDRESS',
      }),
    ],
  });
  ```

  <Config />
</CodeGroup>

### Get an existing CGDAIncentive

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts
// if an incentive address is known, directly construct it
const incentive = core.CGDAIncentive("0xc55F719709bDad022B320E76f9DfF7e6F5680767")

// or if you want a budget from a specific chain
const incentiveOnBase = core.CGDAIncentive(
  "0xc55F719709bDad022B320E76f9DfF7e6F5680767",
  { chainId: 8453 }
)

// or accessible off of a a pre-exiting Boost
const boost = await core.getBoost(0n)
const incentive = boost.incentives.find(incentive => incentive instanceof CGDAIncentive)
```
