description: Interacting directly with Boosts in Node and the Browser
---

The *Boost SDK* is a modern Typescript library for the browser and Node.js that simplifies interacting with the [Boost V2 Protocol](TODO link to protocol here), making creating and interacting with Boosts a breeze.

## Features

*Boost SDK* includes everything you need to create and manage Boosts. Inside, you'll find:

- Browser first support with [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)
- Node.js support with [Viem](https://viem.sh/) accounts
- Modern, supporting both CommonJS and ESM modules
- Easily understood, taking an object oriented design approach
- Well-typed
- Extensible, allowing custom configurations for nearly every common operation

## Design Principles

A few underlying drivers motivate us as engineers as we build this library.

- Developer focused: You should be able to do anything you need to do wherever you need to do it.
- Simple: Selectively abstract away any emergent complexity that you would otherwise face interacting with the protocol directly.
- Interoperable: You should be able to bring the tools you're already using with you.
