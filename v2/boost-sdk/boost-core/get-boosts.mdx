## API

### `getBoost`

Retrieves a single Boost by ID and instantiate the correct interfaces for all components.

```ts
const boost = await core.getBoost(
  1n
)
// You can also supply a numerical string, or hexadecimal representation
const boost = await core.getBoost(
  "1" // or "0x1"
)

// Afterwards, all components will be constructed with their correct interfaces
assert(boost.budget instanceof ManagedBudget)
```

This method also executes several read calls to ascertain the correct Boost component interfaces. If you'd like to save on calls, use [core.readBoost](#readboost) instead, which returns the raw on-chain representation with component addresses instead of instantiated classes.

#### Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string | bigint" required>
A `bigint`, or numerical string, or hexadecimal string.
</ParamField>

<ReadParams />

#### Returns

<ResponseField name="boost" type="Promise<Boost>" required>
  Returns the Boost if found. Otherwise, throws `BoostNotFoundError`
</ResponseField>
