The Managed Budget contract is a flexible budget implementation that allows for the distribution of tokens with role-based access control. A Managed Budget is required to deploy boosts.
In order to deploy boosts from a budget, the budget must be funded with enough ERC-20 tokens to cover the cost of the boost incentives, plus any fees.

ManagedBudget is designed to hold and distribute assets while providing fine-grained control over who can perform various operations.

## Key Features

- Role-based access control for management and administration
- Flexible allocation and distribution of assets
- Clawback functionality for asset recovery

#### Create a new ManagedBudget

**To initialize a new ManagedBudget contract:**

<CodeGroup>

  ```ts index.ts
  import { BoostCore } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostCore'
  import { BoostRegistry } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostRegistry'
  import { ManagedBudgetRoles } from '@boostxyz/sdk/Budgets/ManagedBudget'
  import { config } from "./config";

  const core = new BoostCore({ config });
  const registry = new BoostRegistry({ config });

  // initialize a new budget contract
  const budget = await registry.initialize(
    "MyBoostBudget",
    core.ManagedBudget({
      owner: account.address,
      authorized: [account.address, core.assertValidAddress()],
      roles: [Roles.ADMIN, Roles.MANAGER],
    })
  );

  const budgetAddress = budget.assertValidAddress();
  ```

  <Config />
</CodeGroup>

#### Get an existing ManagedBudget

**To get an existing ManagedBudget contract:**

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts
const budget = core.ManagedBudget("0xc55F719709bDad022B320E76f9DfF7e6F5680767")

// or if you want a budget from a specific chain
const budgetOnBase = core.ManagedBudget(
  "0xc55F719709bDad022B320E76f9DfF7e6F5680767",
  { chainId: 8453 }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

Once a budget is created, it can be [funded](/v2/boost-sdk/budgets/managed/funding) and used to deploy boosts.
