### Peer Dependencies

Boost SDK is designed to work with [Wagmi Configurations](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/createConfig#config) and requires the following peer dependencies

```
"@wagmi/core": "2",
"viem": "2",
"abitype": "1"
```

which, if they are not already in your project, you can include with the following command

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @wagmi/core @wagmi/connectors viem@2.x
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @wagmi/core @wagmi/connectors viem@2.x

### Runtime Requirements

Boost SDK is optimized for modern browsers. It is compatible with the following browsers config

```
Chrome >= 87
Firefox >= 78
Edge >= 88
Safari >= 14
```

> If you want to support older browsers, you need to transpile the library from `node_modules` yourselves.
