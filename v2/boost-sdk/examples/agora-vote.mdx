In this example, you want a certain proposal to pass/fail, and want to incentivize users to swing votes in your favor by offering additional rewards.

<Warning>
Make sure you've completed the [quick start](/v2/boost-sdk/quick-start) guide before proceeding with this example.
</Warning>

First you'll need to either initialize a new budget, or use an existing one, and allow the budget to spend a certain amount of your selected ERC20.

```ts
import { BoostCore } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostCore'
import { BoostRegistry } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostRegistry'
import { ManagedBudget, ManagedBudgetRoles } from '@boostxyz/sdk/Budgets/ManagedBudget'
import { parseUnits } from 'viem'

// Initialize the BoostCore and BoostRegistry modules
const registry = new BoostRegistry({ config: wagmiConfig }),
const core = new BoostCore({ config: wagmiConfig })

// Get the address of the BoostCore module
const coreAddress = core.assertValidAddress()

// Create a new budget and grant the correct permissions to the protocol
const budget = await registry.initialize('MyNewBudget', core.ManagedBudget({
  owner: '0xME',
  authorized: ['0xME', coreAddress],
  roles: [ManagedBudgetRoles.ADMIN, ManagedBudgetRoles.MANAGER]
}))

// Allow the budget to spend your ERC20 token
await writeContract(wagmiConfig, {
  abi,
  address: '0xERC20', // The address of the ERC20 token you want to approve
  functionName: 'approve',
  args: [
    budget.assertValidAddress(),
    parseUnits('100', 18) // The amount of ERC20 token you want to approve
  ]
})

// Allocate assets to the budget
await budget.allocate({
  amount: parseUnits('100', 18),
  asset: '0xERC20',
  target: '0xME',
})
```

Next you'll need to define the action that qualifies a user to claim the reward.

For Agora, we want to reward users that vote for a specific proposal on Agora. To do this, we'll key off of the `VoteCast` event,
which has the event signature `VoteCast(address indexed,uint256,uint8,uint256,string)`.

<Warning>
There is also a `VoteCastWithParams` event. The SDK can only validate one at a time (for now), so this tutorial will just check for the `VoteCast` event.

A workaround for this is to create one boost for `VoteCast` and another boost for `VoteCastWithParams`.
</Warning>

  <img src="/assets/event-vote-cast.png" alt="VoteCast Event" />
</Frame>

Here is how you can structure the EventActionPayload to target the `VoteCast` event.

<Tip>
  If you're using a known event, you can use the selectors package to get the signature.
    ```ts
    import { selectors } from '@boostxyz/signatures/events'
    const selector = selectors[
      'VoteCast(address indexed,uint256,uint8,uint256,string)'
    ] as Hex;
    ```
</Tip>

```ts
import {
  EventActionPayload,
  ActionStep,
  ActionClaimant,
  SignatureType,
  FilterType,
  PrimitiveType
} from '@boostxyz/sdk/Actions/EventAction'
import { selectors } from '@boostxyz/signatures/events'
import { toHex } from 'viem'

const targetContract = '0xcdf27f107725988f2261ce2256bdfcde8b382b10'
// If one exists, use the signature from the selectors package
const selector = selectors[
  'VoteCast(address indexed,uint256,uint8,uint256,string)'
] as Hex;

// These EventAction steps outlines the criteria that the validator uses to determine eligibility for reward redemption.
const filterProposalIdStep: ActionStep = {
  chainid: optimism.id,
  signature: selector, // VoteCast event signature
  signatureType: SignatureType.EVENT, // We're working with an event
  targetContract: targetContract, // Address of the ERC20 contract
  // We want to target the ProposalId property on the VoteCast event
  actionParameter: {
    filterType: FilterType.EQUAL, // Filter to check for equality
    fieldType: PrimitiveType.UINT, // The field we're filtering is a uint
    fieldIndex: 1, // Targeting the 'proposalId' uint
    filterData: toHex(
      BigInt(
        '54194543592303757979358957212312678549449891089859364558242427871997305750980',
      ),
    ), // Filtering based on the proposal id
  },
};
const filterSupportStep: ActionStep = {
  chainid: optimism.id,
  signature: selector, // VoteCast event signature
  signatureType: SignatureType.EVENT, // We're working with an event
  targetContract: targetContract, // Address of the ERC20 contract
  // We want to target the Support property on the VoteCast event
  actionParameter: {
    filterType: FilterType.EQUAL, // Filter to check for equality
    fieldType: PrimitiveType.UINT, // The field we're filtering is a uint
    fieldIndex: 2, // Targeting the 'support' uint
    filterData: toHex(1n, { size: 1 }), // Filtering based on the support value (uint8 is 1 byte)
  },
};
```


Next, we need to define the action claimant and create the payload for the new event action.

The `eventAction` payload consists of the `actionClaimant` and the `actionSteps` we defined previously.
The purpose of the `eventAction` is to track and reward users based on their interactions with the specified event.

1. **actionClaimant**: This object defines the conditions under which a user is eligible to claim rewards. It includes:
   - `signatureType`: Specifies that the signature type is an event.
   - `signature`: The event signature we are targeting, in this case, the `VoteCast` event.
   - `fieldIndex`: Indicates which field in the event data we are interested in; here, it targets the 'voter' address (the address that initiated the vote).
   - `targetContract`: The address of the contract we are monitoring for the event.

2. **actionSteps**: This array can contain up to four action steps that outline the specific actions or conditions that must be met for the event action to be valid. In this example, we include the previously defined `eventActionStepOne` and `eventActionStepTwo`.

Next, we initialize the `EventAction` class from the `bases` module, passing in the default options and the constructed `eventActionPayload`. This creates a new event action.

```ts
const eventActionPayload = {
  actionClaimant: {
    chainid: optimism.id,
    signatureType: SignatureType.EVENT,
    signature: selector, // VoteCast(address,uint256,uint8,uint256,string) event signature
    fieldIndex: 0, // Targeting the 'voter' address
    targetContract: targetContract, // The Agora vote contract we're monitoring
  },
  actionSteps: [filterProposalIdStep, filterSupportStep] // use can place up to 4 action steps
};

// Initialize EventAction with the custom payload
const eventAction = core.EventAction(eventActionPayload);
```

Once the event action is created, we can set up the incentives and deploy our boost.

```ts
// This allows for participants to be rewarded with up to 10 wei of the reward asset. The maximum amount of the rewards distributed by this incentive in this boost would be 100 wei
const incentives = [
    core.ERC20VariableIncentive({
      asset: erc20.assertValidAddress(),
      reward: parseEther('0.1'),
      limit: parseEther('1'),
    }),
  ],
```

```ts
// Deploy the boost
await core.createBoost({
  maxParticipants: 100n, // Set a max number of participants
  budget: budget, // Use the ManagedBudget we set up earlier
  action: eventAction, // Pass the manually created EventAction
  incentives: incentives,
  validator: core.SignerValidator({
    signers: [owner, trustedSigner.account],
    validatorCaller: core.assertValidAddress(),
  }),
  // This allowlist makes this boost available to all addresses. If you want to limit it to a specific address, you can use a SimpleAllowList
  allowList: core.OpenAllowList(),
});
```

After the boost is created, we can then implement logic to determine dynamic rewards.

```ts
// Check the amount of votes the boostImpostor has at the time they made the tx to vote
const getVotesAbi = functions.abi[functions.selectors['getVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber) view returns (uint256)'] as '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000eb9019d4']
const amountOfVotes = (await walletClient.readContract({
  address: '0xcdf27f107725988f2261ce2256bdfcde8b382b10',
  abi: [getVotesAbi],
  functionName: 'getVotes',
  args: ['0xME', 'blockNumber'],
})) as bigint;

// If the amountOfVotes is greater than 100, then the reward should be 0.1 ETH, otherwise it will be 0.01 ETH
const rewardAmount =
  amountOfVotes >= parseEther('100')
    ? parseEther('0.1')
    : parseEther('0.01');
```

Having the `rewardAmount` will allow us to use it as a param when generating the signature payload to allow the user to claim the reward.

```ts
// Generate the signature using the trusted signer
const claimDataPayload = await boost.validator.encodeClaimData({
  signer: trustedSigner,
  incentiveData: encodeAbiParameters(
    [{ name: '', type: 'uint256' }],
    [rewardAmount],
  ),
  chainId: optimism.id,
  incentiveQuantity: 1,
  claimant: boostImpostor,
  boostId: boost.id,
});

// Claim the incentive for the imposter
await core.claimIncentiveFor(
  boost.id,
  0n,
  referrer,
  claimDataPayload,
  boostImpostor,
  { value: parseEther('0.000075') },
);
```
