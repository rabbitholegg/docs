(OFFER A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY)
In this example, you've created an NFT on Zora, and want to incentivize users to mint it by offering additional rewards.

This example presumes that you've read [quick start](TODO_LINK_TO_QUICK_START) guide to familiarize yourself with the SDK's core concepts.

(START OFF WITH BUDGET CONFIG, CUSTOMIZE FOR SPECIFIC INCENTIVES)
First you'll need to either initialize a new budget, or use an existing one, and allow the budget to spend a certain amount of your selected ERC20.

```ts
import { BoostCore } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostCore'
import { BoostRegistry } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostRegistry'
import { ManagedBudget, Roles } from '@boostxyz/sdk'

const registry = new BoostRegistry({ config: wagmiConfig }),
  core = new BoostCore({ config: wagmiConfig })
const coreAddress = core.assertValidAddress()

// to create a new budget and grant the correct permissions to the protocol
const budget = await registry.initialize('MyNewBudget', core.ManagedBudget({
  owner: '0xME',
  authorized: ['0xME', coreAddress],
  roles: [Roles.ADMIN, Roles.MANAGER]
}))
// or use an existing one, ensuring the protocol has the correct level of access
budget = core.ManagedBudget('0xEXISTING_BUDGET_ADDRESS')
// if you've successfully used this budget with the protocol before, you won't need to do this
if ((await budget.isAuthorized(coreAddress)) === false) {
  await budget.grantRoles(coreAddress, Roles.MANAGER)
}

// (CUSTOM) then you'll need to allow the (ERC20) to transfer funds from your account into the budget.
await writeContract(wagmiConfig, { abi, address: '0xERC20', functionName: 'approve', args: [budget.assertValidAddress(), parseEther('100')] })

// finally allocate assets to the budget
await budget.allocate({
  amount: parseEther('100'),
  asset: '0xERC20',
  target: '0xME',
})
```

(CONTINUE WITH THE EVENT ACTION, SPECIFY AS NEEDED)
Next you'll need to define the action taken that qualifies a user to claim the reward.

For a Zora mint, we'll key off of the `Purchased` event, which has the signature `Purchased(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256)`.

```ts
import { EventActionPayload, ActionStep, ActionClaimant, SignatureType, FilterType, PrimitiveType } from '@boostxyz/sdk/Actions/EventAction'
import { selectors } from '@boostxyz/signatures/events'

// We provide a package containing known event signatures so you don't need to know the hex of the signature yourself.
const selectedSignature = selectors[
  'Purchased(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256)'
] as Hex;

// This EventAction step will define how the validator will understand who is eligible to redeem the reward.
const eventActionStep: ActionStep = {
  signature: selectedSignature,
  signatureType: SignatureType.EVENT, // We're working with an event
  targetContract: '0xZORA', // Address of the contract to observe for the event
  // We want to target the Minter property on the Purchase event
  actionParameter: {
    filterType: FilterType.EQUAL, // Filter to check for equality
    fieldType: PrimitiveType.UINT, // The field we're filtering is the tokenId
    fieldIndex: 3,
    filterData: '0xUINT256_TOKEN_ID', // We'll validate by comparing purchase events with a token ID that equals the this field
  },
};

// Similar to the step above, this configuration will identify the user eligible to claim based on them having taken the action triggering the `Purchased` event.
const eventActionClaimant: ActionClaimant = {
  signatureType: SignatureType.EVENT,
  signature: selector, // Transfer(address,address,uint256) event signature
  fieldIndex: 0, // Targeting the 'from' address
  targetContract: boostImpostor, // The ERC20 contract we're monitoring
}
```
