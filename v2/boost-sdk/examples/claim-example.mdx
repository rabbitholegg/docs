description: Learn how to claim rewards from a Boost

In this example, you'll learn how to claim a reward from a Boost.

To claim a reward from a Boost, you'll need to follow these general steps:

1. Retrieve the Boost you want to claim from
2. Get the specific incentive from the Boost
3. Prepare the incentive payload
4. Encode the claim data
5. Execute the claim transaction

```ts
// get the boost you want to claim from
const boost = await core.getBoost(1n)

// get the incentive you want to claim off the boost object
const incentive = boost.incentives[0]

// prepare the incentive payload
let incentivePayload: Hex;

// variable reward incentives require the reward amount to be provided in buildClaimData
if (incentive instanceof ERC20VariableIncentive || 
    incentive instanceof ERC20VariableCriteriaIncentive) {
  const variableRewardAmount = 1n;
  incentivePayload = await incentive.buildClaimData(variableRewardAmount);
} else {
  incentivePayload = incentive.buildClaimData();
}

// encode claimData payload
const claimDataPayload = await boost.validator.encodeClaimData({
  signer: signer.account,
  incentiveData: incentivePayload,
  chainId: 8453,
  incentiveQuantity: 1,
  claimant: "0xCLAIMANT", // the address of the account claiming the incentive
  boostId: boost.id,
});

// claim the incentive from the boost
await core.claimIncentive(
  boost.id,
  0n, // the incentiveId (position in the array of incentives)
  "0xCLAIMANT", // the claimant
  claimDataPayload,
);
```

<Warning>
  The claimant must be authorized to claim the incentive. (*ie: on allowlist and passes validation*)
</Warning>

You can also claim on behalf of another user by using the `claimIncentiveFor` method.

```ts
await core.claimIncentiveFor(
  boost.id,
  0n, // the incentiveId (position in the array of incentives)
  "0xREFERER", // referrer (if any). use zero address if no referrer
  claimDataPayload,
  "0xCLAIMANT", // the address of the account the claim is being made for
);
```
