description: Learn how to claim ERC20 rewards from a Boost
---

Boost Protocol allows users to claim ERC20 rewards from Boosts. This process involves interacting with the Boost contract to verify eligibility and receive the allocated incentives. 

To claim an ERC20 reward from a Boost, you'll need to follow these general steps:

1. Retrieve the Boost you want to claim from
2. Get the specific incentive from the Boost
3. Prepare the incentive payload
4. Encode the claim data
5. Execute the claim transaction

```ts
// get the boost you want to claim from
const boost = await core.getBoost(1n)

// get the incentive you want to claim off the boost object
const incentive = boost.incentives[0]

// prepare the incentive payload
let incentivePayload

if (incentive instanceof ERC20VariableIncentive) {
  const incentivePayload = await incentive.buildClaimData(1n)
}

// encode claimData payload
const claimDataPayload = await boost.validator.encodeClaimData({
  signer: signer.account,
  incentiveData: incentivePayload,
  chainId: 8453,
  incentiveQuantity: 1,
  claimant: "0xCLAIMANT", // the address of the account claiming the incentive
  boostId: boost.id,
});

// claim the incentive from the boost
await core.claimIncentive(
  boost.id,
  0n, // position in the array of incentives
  account.address, // the claimant
  claimDataPayload,
  { value: parseEther('0.000075') }, // claim fee
);
```

<Warning>
  The claimant must be authorized to claim the incentive. (*ie: on allowlist and passes validation*)
</Warning>

You can also claim on behalf of another user by using the `claimIncentiveFor` method.

```ts
await core.claimIncentiveFor(
  boost.id,
  0n, // the incentiveId (0n is for the ERC20Incentive strategy)
  "0xREFERER", // referrer (if any) use zero address if no referrer
  claimDataPayload,
  "0xCLAIMANT", // the address of the account the claim is being made for
  { value: parseEther('0.000075') }, // claim fee
);
```
