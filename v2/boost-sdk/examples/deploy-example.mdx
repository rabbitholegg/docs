In this example, you'll learn how to deploy a Boost using the Boost SDK.

Before you deploy a boost, you will need to have a budget account deployed and funded with the tokens you want to distribute. 
If you don't have one, you can deploy one using the [SDK](/v2/boost-sdk/budgets/managed/overview#create-a-new-managedbudget), or by following 
the [Budget Accounts guide](/v2/documentation/how-it-works/budget-accounts) to deploy one through the Boost V2 interface.

Once you have a budget account, you can access its methods by calling `core.ManagedBudget(address)`, where `address` 
is the address of the budget account.

Below is a full example of how to deploy a Boost using the SDK. The action in this example targets 
the Zora TimedSalesStrategy contract. The main steps to deploying a boost are:

1. Setting up the Action
2. Setting up the Incentives
3. Deploying the Boost

You can also optionally set up an AllowList, which is useful if you want to limit the participants of the boost.
This example uses the OpenAllowList, which allows anyone to participate.

    ```typescript index.ts
    import { BoostCore } from "@boostxyz/sdk";
    import { config } from "./config";
    import { eventActionPayload } from "./eventAction";

    const core = new BoostCore(config);
    const budget = core.ManagedBudget('0x...');
    const action = core.EventAction(eventActionPayload);

    const incentives: [
      core.ERC20Incentive({
        asset: '0x...',
        reward: parseEther('0.5'),
        limit: 10n,
        strategy: StrategyType.POOL,
        manager: '0x...',
      }),
    ]

    (async () => {
      await core.deployBoost(
        {
          maxParticipants: 10n,
          budget,
          action,
          incentives,
          allowList: core.OpenAllowList(),
        },
      )
    })();
