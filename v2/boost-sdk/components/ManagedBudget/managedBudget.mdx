import Config from '/snippets/config.mdx';

The ManagedBudget is a flexible budget implementation that allows for the distribution of tokens (ERC-20 and native) with role-based access control. A Managed Budget is required to deploy boosts.

## Overview

ManagedBudget is designed to hold and distribute assets while providing fine-grained control over who can perform various operations. It supports ETH, ERC-20 based assets.

## Key Features

- Role-based access control for management and administration
- Support for multiple asset types (ETH, ERC-20)
- Flexible allocation and distribution of assets
- Clawback functionality for asset recovery

## Usage

To initialize a new ManagedBudget contract:

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts index.ts
  import { BoostCore } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostCore'
  import { BoostRegistry } from '@boostxyz/sdk/BoostRegistry'
  import { ManagedBudgetRoles } from '@boostxyz/sdk/Budgets/ManagedBudget'
  import { config } from "./config";

  const core = new BoostCore({ config });
  const registry = new BoostRegistry({ config });

  // initialize a new budget contract
  const budget = await registry.initialize(
    "MyBoostBudget",
    core.ManagedBudget({
      owner: account.address,
      authorized: [account.address, core.assertValidAddress()],
      roles: [ManagedBudgetRoles.ADMIN, ManagedBudgetRoles.MANAGER],
    })
  );

  const budgetAddress = budget.assertValidAddress();
  ```
  <Config />
</CodeGroup>

To get an existing ManagedBudget contract:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts
import { BoostCore } from "@boostxyz/sdk/BoostCore";
import { ManagedBudget } from "@boostxyz/sdk/Budgets/ManagedBudget";
import { config } from "./config";

const budget = new ManagedBudget(
  { config }, 
  "0x57189e5258F39b6571f8ac14feF64D108c347f2a" // the address of a budget that has been deployed
)
```
<Config />
</CodeGroup>
