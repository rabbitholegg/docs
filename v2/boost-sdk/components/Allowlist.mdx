Allow Lists and Deny Lists are flexible mechanisms in the Boost protocol for managing access control. They provide simple ways to either allow or deny specific addresses from participating in a Boost.

## Overview

The Boost protocol offers three main types of lists for access control:

- **SimpleAllowList**: Explicitly allows specified addresses.
- **SimpleDenyList**: Allows all addresses except those explicitly denied.
- **OpenAllowList**: A special implementation of SimpleDenyList where no addresses are denied, effectively allowing all addresses (public access).

These lists offer straightforward methods to manage access control for Boosts, providing flexibility in how you manage participant access.

## Usage
To create and use these lists:

If you just want to use an allowlist one time, you can use set it up directly on the createBoost call.
