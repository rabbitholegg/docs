title: "Boost V2 vs. Boost V1"
description: "A comprehensive comparison of Boost V2 and Boost V1 features and architecture"
---

### Boost V1

- Static reward structures
- Primarily off-chain validation
- Limited flexibility in incentivized actions
- User abstractions for easy transactions
- Basic programmability options
- Limited development tools

### Boost V2

- Dynamic reward structures
- On-chain validation for enhanced security
- Modular architecture with flexible reward structures
- Can incentivize actions on any external smart contract
- Advanced programmability for complex incentive programs
- Full open-source BoostSDK for easier protocol interaction

## Tradeoff Comparison

| Aspect | Boost V1 | Boost V2 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Reward Structure | Static, predetermined | Dynamic, adaptive |
| Validation Mechanism | Primarily off-chain | On-chain validation |
| Flexibility | Limited to specific actions | Can incentivize any smart contract action |
| User Experience | User abstractions for easy transactions | More complex, powerful features |
| Integration | Basic integration options | Enhanced integration capabilities |
| Programmability | Basic options | Advanced features for complex programs |
| Development Tools | Limited | Full open-source BoostSDK |
