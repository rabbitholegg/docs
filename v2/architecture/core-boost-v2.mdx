The Boost V2 core protocol architecture is designed to enable flexible, secure, and efficient on-chain incentivization. It consists of several key components that work together to validate actions, generate proofs, and distribute rewards. Here's a breakdown of the architecture:

## Components

- **User**: The end-user interacting with the system.
- **ExternalContract**: The smart contract with which the user interacts to perform the incentivized action.
- **BackendValidator**: An off-chain component that validates the user's action.
- **Core**: The central smart contract of the Boost protocol.
- **SignerValidator**: An on-chain component that verifies the proof of the user's action.

## Process Flow

1. **Action Execution**:
   - The User executes an action on the ExternalContract.
   - This action is the behavior that Boost aims to incentivize.

2. **Off-chain Validation**:
   - The BackendValidator observes and validates the action off-chain.
   - This allows for complex validation logic without incurring high gas costs.

3. **Signature Generation**:
   - Upon successful validation, the BackendValidator generates a cryptographic signature.
   - This signature serves as a proof that the user performed the specified action.

4. **Signature Submission**:
   - The User submits the signature to the Core contract.
   - This step initiates the on-chain portion of the claiming process.

5. **On-chain Verification**:
   - The Core contract calls the SignerValidator with the provided signature.
   - The SignerValidator uses EIP-712 signature validation to verify the proof.
   - EIP-712 provides a secure method for signing and verifying structured data.

6. **Reward Distribution**:
   - If the signature is valid, the Core contract distributes the incentive to the User.

## Choosing a Reward

When setting up a Boost, it's crucial to choose an appropriate reward structure that aligns with your project's goals and tokenomics. Here are some considerations:

1. **Token Type**: 
   - Native tokens (e.g., ETH)
   - Project-specific tokens
   - Stablecoins (e.g., USDC, DAI)

2. **Reward Amount**:
   - Fixed amount per action
   - Percentage-based rewards
   - Tiered rewards based on action value or user status

3. **Reward Frequency**:
   - Immediate distribution upon action completion
   - Periodic distributions (e.g., daily, weekly)
   - Milestone-based rewards

4. **Reward Caps**:
   - Per-user caps to prevent exploitation
   - Total reward caps for budget control
   - Time-based caps (e.g., daily limits)

5. **Vesting or Lock-up Periods**:
   - Immediate availability
   - Gradual vesting to encourage long-term engagement
   - Lock-up periods for larger rewards

When choosing a reward structure, consider factors such as:
- The perceived value of the incentivized action
- Your project's token supply and inflation rate
- User behavior and motivation
- Regulatory compliance and tax implications

A well-designed reward structure can effectively drive desired user actions while maintaining the economic balance of your ecosystem.

## Key Improvements in V2

- **Flexibility**: The architecture allows for incentivizing actions on any external contract, greatly expanding the use cases for Boost.
- **Gas Efficiency**: By moving complex validation off-chain and only verifying a compact signature on-chain, gas costs are significantly reduced.
- **Security**: The use of EIP-712 for structured data signing ensures that the proofs are secure and tamper-resistant.
- **Scalability**: The off-chain validation allows for handling complex conditions and high volumes of actions without congesting the blockchain.
- **Modularity**: The separation of concerns between different components (ExternalContract, BackendValidator, Core, SignerValidator) allows for easier upgrades and maintenance.
