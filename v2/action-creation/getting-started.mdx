# Getting Started

To begin creating your boost action, you'll need to use Etherscan to analyze relevant transactions. Here's how to get started:

1. Go to [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/)
2. In the search bar at the top, paste a transaction hash (a long string of letters and numbers)
3. Press Enter or click the search icon

You'll now see a page full of information about the transaction. This information will be crucial for setting up your boost action.

In the following sections, we'll break down each part of the Etherscan transaction page and explain how to use this information in your boost creation process.
