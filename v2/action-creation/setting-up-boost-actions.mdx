Now that you understand the key components of a transaction, let's look at how to set up effective Boost actions.

## Key Fields for Boost Actions

1. **To (Contract Address)**: Defines which contract you're targeting
2. **Signature (Function Name)**: Specifies the action within the contract
3. **Log Signature (Event Name)**: Crucial for many DeFi interactions
4. **Claimant**: Ensures the right users are rewarded

## Creating Effective Boosts

1. Start with the contract address in the "To" field
2. Use the "Signature" field to specify the function
3. Set parameter filters to target specific transaction values
4. Use log filters to capture successful outcomes
5. Refine with claimant filters to target or exclude specific users

## Example Templates

1. **Large Token Transfers**:
   - To: [Token Contract Address]
   - Signature: transfer
   - Parameter Filter: amount >= [Significant Amount]

2. **DEX Swaps**:
   - To: [DEX Router Address]
   - Signature: swapExactTokensForTokens
   - Log Filter: Swap event with amount0In or amount1In >= [Significant Amount]

3. **NFT Minting**:
   - To: [NFT Contract Address]
   - Signature: mint
   - Log Filter: Transfer event with from address being 0x0

Remember to use the "Filter Preview" in the Boost Deploy flow to ensure your filters are capturing the intended transactions.
