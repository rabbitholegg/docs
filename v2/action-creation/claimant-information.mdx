# Claimant Information

The Claimant is typically the address that performed the action you want to reward with your boost. Here's how to identify and use this information:

## Finding the Claimant

- **Where to find it**: In most cases, the Claimant will be the same as the "From" address we identified earlier.
- **For complex cases**: Look in the "Logs" section for events that indicate a specific action was performed.

## Examples

### Simple Transfer

- Claimant would be the "From" address: 0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D

### Complex DeFi Interaction
