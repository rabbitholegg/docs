# Logs Section

The Logs section on Etherscan provides detailed information about events that occurred during the transaction. Here's how to use this information:

## Address

- The contract address is shown at the top of each log
- **Example**: Address: 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 (USDC token contract)
- **How to use it**: Enter this address in the "Address" field of the Log Filter in the Boost Deploy flow

## Signature

- The event name is shown if the contract is verified
- **Example**: Event: Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)
- **How to use it**: Select this event (e.g., "Transfer") in the "Signature" dropdown of the Log Filter

## Parameter Filters

Below the event name, you'll see a list of parameters and their values.

### Example: Transfer Event
